# SBV - Signal and Image Processing

Introduction to digital data processing, Fourier transform and convolution theorem, discrete Fourier transform, sampling theorem, adaptive filters (Wiener and Kalman filters), modeling multidimensional data, simple algorithms of digital image processing, simple filters as mask operations, binary morphology, segmentation, surface modeling and triangulation, rendering with illumination models, entropy, redundancy and compression.

Professor: Dipl.-Ing.(FH) Dr. Gerald Adam Zwettler, MSc

## Content

To work on the different tasks we use [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html) in this class. The implementation of different filters is mainly done as a custom plugin, which is then applied to different images.

## Usage

If you want to use the implementation yourself make sure to also download `ImageJUtility.java` located in `00_dependencies`. Inside ImageJ navigate to `Plugins > Install...` and select the .java files in your download location. Now you should find the plugin listed in `Plugins`.
