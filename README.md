## About HCC

The human-machine interface is becoming increasingly important due to the massive digitization of our world. User-centered design and responsible innovation play an important role in this.

The networking of humans and computers is becoming ever closer as digitization advances in all areas of our lives. To ensure that the increasingly complex technology behind it is also future-proof and human-centric, interfaces have to be adapted much more closely to the needs of people. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, which students in the master's program in Human Centered Computing will learn in its entirety.

The part-time master's program offers comprehensive training in the field of human-centered design with a focus on interaction design and UX, data processing and visualization, interaction techniques and responsible innovation, as well as in the fields of psychology and physiology.
